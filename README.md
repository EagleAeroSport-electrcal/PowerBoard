# PowerBoard

The structure might be a bit odd, because I'm using two additional libraries. One, which
was for the fuse symbol/footprint I made, was created locally within the project. The other,
the samacys stuff, for the converter and capacitor, was downloaded off mouser.

Additional note: I did edit the symbol for the converter, removing the leads for the mounting holes.
the hole/pads are still there in the footprint.
